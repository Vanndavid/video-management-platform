#  Media Analysis System 

A media engine designed for the Real Estate industry allowing agents to upload large property videos without blocking the UI, processes them in the background, and captures user interaction data to analyse viewing engagement.

##  Overview

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Backend API** | Laravel 11 (API-only) | Video upload, queue jobs, analytics |
| **Frontend** | Vue 3 + Vuetify | Dashboard for upload & listing |
| **Queue** | Redis 7 + Laravel Queue | Simulated transcoding jobs |
| **Database** | SQLite | Store listings, videos, assets, events |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Traefik v3 | HTTPS routing for frontend + API |
| **Runtime** | Docker Compose | Local + server environment parity |

##  Features

-  **Video Uploads** — Upload MP4/WebM files per listing  
-  **Async Job Flow** — Queues a *TranscodeVideoJob* that simulates processing  
-  **Status Tracking** — `UPLOADED → PROCESSING → READY / FAILED`  
-  **Asset Management** — Stores original videos and mock renditions in `/storage/app/public/videos`  
-  **Playback Analytics** — Tracks play/completion events and returns top-played videos  
-  **Vue Dashboard** — View listings, upload new videos, and see analytics summary  
-  **Containerized Stack** — Laravel + Vue + Redis + Traefik in one Docker Compose setup

##  Testing

Feature tests verify:
- `/api/health` endpoint responds with 200 OK  
- `/api/videos` creates a new record and dispatches a queue job
